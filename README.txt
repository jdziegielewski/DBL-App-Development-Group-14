THIS IS A README OF SLEAP APP MADE BY GROUP 14 FOR DBL APP DEVELOPMENT COURSE AT THE EINDHOVEN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY
First things first:
HOW TO INSTALL OUR APP?
It's very easy!
On non-Samsung devices:
	- Go to your phone’s Settings.
	- Go to Security & privacy > More settings.
	- Tap on Install apps from external sources.
	- Select the browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox) you want to download the 	  APK files from.
	- Toggle Allow app installs ON.
On Samsung devices:
	- Go to your phone’s Settings.
	- Go to Biometrics and security > Install unknown apps.
	- Select the browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox) you want to download the 	  APK files from.
	- Toggle Allow app installs ON.
Then:
- Download the APK file provided by Group 14. You can see a pop-up asking if you want to let your browser save files to your phone's storage. Accept this. The warnign "This type of file can harm your device." could be seen.
- Click OK to continue.
- If your phone's web browser doesn't give you the option to open the file              after downloading, then open the file explorer app you installed, and go to  the Downloads folder on your device.
- Tap the APK file. Allow the app any required permissions it asks for. Then,    at the bottom of the installer window, click INSTALL.
- You'll see a confirmation the app is installed. Now you'll see the app available in your list of installed apps.

You are now ready to use our App Sleap. Enjoy! We hope you will not have a problem with waking up ever again.
Greetings!

Remarks:
In the implementation of application SLEAP we have used third party for some of a features.
For detecting a shake of the phone in the shake challenge we used seismic libary: com.squareup:seismic:1.0.2
For reading the barcodes and QR codes in the barcode challenge we used zxing libary:  me.dm7.barcodescanner:zxing:1.9
For presenting the percentage of challenges completed by the user in a pie-chart we used a github library": com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:v3.0.3
We have also made use of Firebase SDK for Google Analytics and an android library multiDex.
